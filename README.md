# BIO-GEN ECOSYSTEM

* Bio-Gen eco-system is a Java swing application which integrates data coming from all areas of healthcare value system to do analytics on data of the healthcare value chain from chemical compounds to all the way to patient’s treatment and recovery. Bio-Gen eco-system maintains statistical data of an active chemical compound effective in targeting a certain gene in a disease and provides a chemical compound to the test the effectiveness in targeting other diseases that share the same gene. We believe that adopting a common global data standard and upgrading healthcare value system would benefit Bio-Gen eco-system in further improvements of patient care.

# Approach

*	To help Bio-Gen integrate data coming from different sources of healthcare system. 
*	To provide a common platform for global biotechnology company like Bio-Gen to focus on the development and marketing of new drugs for the   treatment of disease in healthcare patients anywhere in the world.
*	Drug enterprise keeps tracks of the gene and their targeting chemical compound. This way, a drug manufacturer can create a new drug in     the future when a new disease is occurred by combination of existing genes to avoid any delays in manufacturing a new drug.

# Areas to focus

* THE APPLICATION FOCUSES TO DO ANALYSIS ON DATA BIOGEN OWNS IN ALL PHASES OF HEALTHCARE VALUE CHAIN FROM CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS TO ALL THE WAY  TO PATIENT’S TREATMENT AND RECOVERY.
* DATA MANAGEMENT
* PROCUREMENT – PROVIDING A METHOD FOR INVENTORY TRACKING
* INFORMATION SHARING & COLLABORATION- SENDING THE DISEASE-RELATED INFORMATION FROM THE HOSPITAL TO THE LAB AND LAB TO THE DRUG COMPANY  FROM THERE TO CHEMICAL ENTERPRISE.
* INVOLVING PATIENTS FOR CLINICAL TRIALS.
* PROVIDE A DASHBOARD FOR BIOGEN TO VIEW SALES OF MEDCINE, PREDOMIDANT GENE IN ALL DISEASES AND COMMON DISEASE IN A NETWORK.

# Conclusion

* We believe that adopting a common global data standard and upgrading healthcare value system would benefit Bio-Gen eco-system in further improvements of patient care. 
* Also, safer and cost-effective healthcare can be provided to millions of patients across the country.
* Keeping track of inventory across multiple enterprises helps in faster deliver of medicines to patients.
